# Speeding Up Your Python Codes 1000x

Welcome to this workshop!

In this repository, you will find a [Jupyter Notebook](orbits.ipynb)
that walks you through step-by-step optimizations using a classic
n-body simulation.
We start with simple improvements like list comprehensions and
reducing operation counts, then move on to advanced techniques with
high-performance libraries such as `NumPy` and Google `JAX`,
just-in-time compilation, and GPU acceleration.

The result is a performance boost of over 1000x, empowering you to
process complex datasets, train AI models, or run detailed simulations
efficiently.
Enjoy the journey and unlock Python's true potential!
