# Speeding Up Your Python Codes 1000x

Python is a favorite for data science and scientific computing, but
its interpreted nature can be a performance bottleneck.
In this workshop, we will explore practical techniques to supercharge
Python performance, including vectorization, parallel/distributed
computing, just-in-time compilation, and GPU acceleration.
We will also cover profiling best practices to benchmark and optimize
codes.
Whether you're processing large datasets, training AI models, or
running simulations, these strategies will help you achieve speedups
of up to 1000x.
